What's **Behavioral online experiment** framework?

Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

The development of experiments for the collection of information and measures from participants on human behavior have been increasingly implemented on web platforms. The recent health crisis and the diversity of the population that can be affected are two main reasons for this trend.

However, setting up such a platform is not necessarily easy, because it requires skills to create such a website. This framework aims to propose a generic approach to online experience design in order to simplify this task for those wishing to create one.

The proposed framework is based on the Django Python framework, which allows the integration of python code for experience management in backend. Moreover, it proposes a certain way to approach an experiment, making it as generic as possible:
